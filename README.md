# Nearest-Earth-Objects-Classification
Data Cleaning: We handle missing values and ensure the dataset is clean.
EDA: Visualizations help in understanding data distributions and relationships between features and class imbalance
Data Preprocessing: Categorical features are encoded, and numerical features are scaled. We handle the imbalanced target class with SMOTE
Model Training and Evaluation: We train a RandomForest model, evaluate it with common metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) and plot an AUC-ROC curve to assess the modelâ€™s performance
